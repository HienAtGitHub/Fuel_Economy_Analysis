# Fuel_Economy_Analysis
Every year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides fuel economy data to the Government, and it gets published in the [annual Fuel Economy Guide](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/)
This report explores and analyzes fuel economy data (retrieved from the [Fuel Economy website](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml/)) for different car models in 2008 and 2018 to answer the below questions:
1.	Are more unique models using alternative sources of fuel? By how much?
2.	How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy?
3.	What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time?
4.	What features are associated with better fuel economy?
